                        Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
                        
                        You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful? '! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Saving the world with meals on wheels.
                        You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!
                        
                        You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
                        
                        It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
                        Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

Don't call me the Rotmeister.
                        
                        You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

                        Saving the world with meals on wheels.
                        
                        I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
                        
                        I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You've swallowed a planet! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!
                        No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
                        
                        I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
                        
                        Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
                        You've swallowed a planet!
                        
                        *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
                        
                        I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
                        
                        Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
                        
                        I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

                        I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
                        
                        You hit me with a cricket bat. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

                        Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?
                        
                        Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You hit me with a cricket bat. Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
                        
                        I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
