                    Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
                    
                    I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

                    Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
                    Saving the world with meals on wheels.

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
                    
                    *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
